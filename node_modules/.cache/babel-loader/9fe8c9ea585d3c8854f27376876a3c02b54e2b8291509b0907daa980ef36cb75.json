I'm Kevin, a passionate software engineer with a knack for problem-solving and a love for coding My journey into the world of software engineering began in 2020 when I decided to pursue my dream while living in the vibrant city of Bangkok. However, my path to becoming a developer was anything but traditional. Prior to diving into coding, I led a diverse life, exploring and taking on different roles. I had the privilege of teaching English online and even engaging in the thrilling world of martial arts, specifically Muay Thai & MMA. However, fate had a different plan for me. A knee injury forced me to slow down and reevaluate my career path. It was during this time that I rediscovered my passion for coding and decided to give it another shot. Despite previous setbacks, I knew that with determination and a fresh perspective, I would succeed. I started my journey afresh, this time with Python as my chosen language. I delved into online tutorials and books, spending countless hours honing my coding skills. Although it wasn't always smooth sailing, I persisted, motivated by the words of encouragement from friends and the belief that every experience, contributes to growth. To ensure I was on the right track, I sought advice from experienced programmers who emphasized the importance of structure and a clear learning path. With their guidance, I enrolled in Codecademy, where I further developed my Python skills and expanded my knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Codecademy provided a solid foundation, but I craved a more immersive learning experience that would allow me to apply my skills in practical projects. That's when I discovered Flat Iron School. Following the recommendation of a friend who shared my passion for both coding and martial arts, I made the bold decision to quit my job and join the bootcamp. It was a leap of faith that changed my life. Through intensive training and hands-on projects, I gained invaluable experience and learned to tackle real-world challenges head-on. Today, I'm an enthusiastic software engineer, eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to create innovative solutions. Whether it's building user-friendly websites or developing robust applications, I approach each project with a combination of creativity, determination, and attention to detail. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new martial arts techniques, enjoying a good cup of coffee at a local cafe, or immersing myself in the latest technology trends. I'm always up for a challenge and ready to take on new opportunities in the ever-evolving world of software engineering.
