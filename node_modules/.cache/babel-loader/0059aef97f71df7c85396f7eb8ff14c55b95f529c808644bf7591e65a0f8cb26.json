I'm Kevin, a passionate software engineer with a knack for problem-solving and a love for coding My journey into the world of software engineering began in 2020 when I decided to pursue my dream while living in the city of Bangkok.

I had the privilege of teaching English online and even engaging in the thrilling world of martial arts, specifically Muay Thai & MMA. However, fate had a different plan for me. A knee injury forced me to slow down and reevaluate my career path. It was during this time that I rediscovered my passion for coding and decided to give it another shot. Despite previous setbacks, I knew that with determination and a fresh perspective, I would succeed. I started my journey afresh, this time with Python as my chosen language. I delved into online tutorials and books, spending countless hours honing my coding skills. Although it wasn't always smooth sailing, I persisted, motivated by the words of encouragement from friends and the belief that every experience, contributes to growth. To ensure I was on the right track, I sought advice from experienced programmers who emphasized the importance of structure and a clear learning path. With their guidance, I signed up to Codecademy, where I further developed my Python skills and expanded my knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Codecademy provided a solid foundation, but I craved a more immersive learning experience that would allow me to apply my skills in practical projects.\"\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 13,\n      columnNumber: 7\n    }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"img\", {\n      className: \"codinggif\",\n      src: \"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5616AQG9Ig_oCeIBlg/profile-displaybackgroundimage-shrink_350_1400/0/1685647981093?e=1703721600&v=beta&t=zyATnVmcc0u1LLY7-CZMbHaflQhBofTteYB_vZIto4k\",\n      alt: \"Animated GIF\"\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 25,\n      columnNumber: 1\n    }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"p\", {\n      className: \"exsectP \",\n      children: \"That's when I discovered Flat Iron School.
